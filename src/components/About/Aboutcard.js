            <br />As a Full Stack Developer I enjoy using a muiltitude of technologies to bring a crisp and quality product to the client. Currently I am earning an intensive Full Stack Coding Certificate at the University of Oregon. I am gaining experience in the foundations of web development while honing my skills in HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, jQuery, MERN, MySQL, React and GraphQL. I am someone who always wants to learn and enjoys problem-solving to create new solutions for making people's lives better. Looking to bring my attention to detail and technical skills to a company to grow and become a valuable asset.
